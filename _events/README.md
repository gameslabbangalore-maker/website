# Event front matter quickstart

When adding a new event, copy an existing `.md` file in this folder and update the values. The full schema with explanations lives in [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

At minimum, make sure to fill out:
- `card_image`, `card_intro`, and `card_location_label` so homepage cards have fallbacks.
- `banner`, `tagline`, and the long-form sections (`about`, `what_makes_it_different`, `how_it_works`, `why_join`, `closing`).
