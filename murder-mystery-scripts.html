        <h2 id="scripts-faq-title">Your questions, answered</h2>
        <p>Still unsure about running your own game? Here are the most common things hosts ask us.</p>
      </div>
      <details>
        <summary>How many people can play with one script?</summary>
        <p>Each story specifies the minimum and maximum players. Most kits cover 12–20 roles, and we include alternates so you can flex up or down without breaking the plot.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can we customise the characters or theme?</summary>
        <p>Absolutely. Editable files let you tweak names, pronouns, or settings. If you’d like deeper customisation, mention it in your enquiry and we can quote an add-on.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer facilitators if we change our mind?</summary>
        <p>Yes! If you decide you’d prefer a hosted experience, our team can step in. We’ll credit your script purchase towards the facilitation package.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long does the game usually run?</summary>
        <p>Most mysteries take about 3–4 hours including an introduction, two acts of investigation, and the final accusation round. You’ll get pacing notes to speed up or slow down.</p>
