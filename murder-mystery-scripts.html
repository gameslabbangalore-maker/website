        <h2 id="scripts-faq-title">Your questions, answered</h2>
        <p>Still unsure about running your own game? Here are the most common things hosts ask us.</p>
      </div>
      <details>
        <summary>How many people can play with one script?</summary>
        <p>Each story specifies the minimum and maximum players. Most kits cover 12â€“20 roles, and we include alternates so you can flex up or down without breaking the plot.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can we customise the characters or theme?</summary>
        <p>Absolutely. Editable files let you tweak names, pronouns, or settings. If youâ€™d like deeper customisation, mention it in your enquiry and we can quote an add-on.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer facilitators if we change our mind?</summary>
        <p>Yes! If you decide youâ€™d prefer a hosted experience, our team can step in. Weâ€™ll credit your script purchase towards the facilitation package.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long does the game usually run?</summary>
        <p>Most mysteries take about 3â€“4 hours including an introduction, an open discussion, accusations and discussions, building timelines and the final round where the complete story comes out. You can ask our team for pacing notes to speed up or slow down.</p>
